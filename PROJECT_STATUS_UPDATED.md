# PROJECT STATUS - Brain-Go-Brrr (UPDATED WITH TRUTH)

_Last Updated: July 30, 2025 - CRITICAL BUG DISCOVERED_

## 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATE: Summary Token Fix NOT Working!

### 📊 Production Readiness: 50% (was 75%)

**Verdict: NOT MVP-Ready - Summary tokens don't load due to embed_dim mismatch**

Major issue discovered: While the summary token architecture was fixed, the weights don't actually load from the checkpoint due to a shape mismatch (768 vs 512). The `strict=False` parameter silently ignores this, leaving summary tokens randomly initialized. Features remain non-discriminative (cosine similarity = 1.0).

## 🔴 Current ACTUAL State

### What's Actually Broken:

1. **Summary Tokens Don't Load** ❌
   - Architecture expects embed_dim=768
   - Checkpoint has embed_dim=512
   - `strict=False` silently ignores mismatch
   - Summary tokens remain random
   - Features are non-discriminative

2. **All Predictions Are Random** ❌
   - Abnormality detection: ~50/50 random
   - No actual feature discrimination
   - Linear probes can't work with bad features

3. **Tests Give False Confidence** ⚠️
   - Tests pass but don't reflect reality
   - May be using different initialization
   - Created false sense of progress

### What Actually Works:

1. **Infrastructure** ✅
   - CI/CD pipeline is green
   - API structure exists
   - Training scripts ready
   - Data available (Sleep-EDF)

2. **Code Architecture** ✅
   - Summary token implementation correct
   - Linear probe classes ready
   - Training pipeline built

## 🔧 The Fix (1 Hour)

In `eegpt_architecture.py` line 484:
```python
# Change from:
model.load_state_dict(encoder_state, strict=False)

# To:
model.load_state_dict(encoder_state, strict=True)
```

This will reveal the shape mismatch and force proper debugging.

## 📅 Realistic Timeline

### Today (1 day):
1. Fix embed_dim mismatch
2. Verify features are discriminative
3. Start sleep probe training

### This Week (5 days):
1. Train sleep probe to 60%+ accuracy
2. Train abnormality probe
3. Wire into API
4. Create demo

### Next Week:
1. Performance optimization
2. Clinical validation
3. Production deployment prep

## 💰 Commercial Impact

**Current Value: $0** - Without discriminative features, the product doesn't work

**After Fix: Viable MVP** - Can deliver sleep staging and abnormality detection

## 📊 Corrected Metrics

| Component | Previous Claim | Actual State | Fix Effort |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| EEGPT Features | "Working" | Non-discriminative | 1 hour |
| Predictions | "Meaningful" | Random | Needs features |
| Tests | "All passing" | False confidence | Re-validate |
| MVP Ready | "75%" | 50% | 1 week |

## 🎯 Immediate Actions

1. **Fix embed_dim mismatch** (1 hour)
2. **Verify features discriminate** (30 min)
3. **Train sleep probe** (4 hours)
4. **Update all docs with truth** (Done)

## 📝 Lessons Learned

1. **Don't use `strict=False`** without validation
2. **Test actual behavior**, not just shapes
3. **Verify checkpoint compatibility** before declaring victory
4. **Documentation must reflect reality**, not hopes

---

**Bottom Line**: We're not as far along as we thought, but the fix is simple. One line of code stands between us and working features.
