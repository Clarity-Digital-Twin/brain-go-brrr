## üìû Executive Summary

### What We Have

- **Strong Foundation**: Well-architected codebase with excellent patterns
- **Core Features**: QC and sleep analysis working
- **Good Documentation**: Comprehensive technical docs
- **EEGPT Integration**: Successfully integrated foundation model

### What We Need

- **Testing**: Increase coverage from 63.47% to 80%
- **Security**: Add authentication and audit logging
- **Deployment**: Create production infrastructure
- **Validation**: Clinical performance metrics

### Timeline to Production

- **Alpha Release**: Ready now (v0.3.0-alpha)
- **Beta Release**: 4-6 weeks (with testing)
- **Production Ready**: 2-3 months
- **FDA Submission**: 6+ months

### Investment Required

- **Engineering**: 2-3 developers for 3 months
- **QA**: 1 QA engineer for 3 months
- **Clinical**: Partnership for validation
- **Infrastructure**: ~$5K/month for cloud resources

---

**Bottom Line**: This is a well-designed system with strong bones but needs significant work before handling real patient data. The 2-3 month timeline is aggressive but achievable with focused effort on testing, security, and deployment infrastructure.
