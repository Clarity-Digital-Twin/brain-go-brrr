# PROJECT STATUS - Brain-Go-Brrr

_Last Updated: July 22, 2024 - End of Day_

## 🎯 Where We Are Today

### ✅ Major Wins Today

1. **Fixed Redis Serialization Issue (#29)**
   - JobData objects now properly serialize/deserialize
   - Added automatic dataclass handling in cache layer
   - All Redis-related tests now passing

2. **Recovered Critical EEG Datasets**
   - Restored 58GB TUAB (Abnormal) dataset
   - Restored 12GB TUEV (Events) dataset
   - Maintained 8.1GB Sleep-EDF dataset
   - Total: 78GB of EEG data properly organized

3. **Synchronized All Branches**
   - development, staging, and main all at commit `51a30cc`
   - Fixed .gitignore to properly exclude /data/ directory
   - Clean git status with no artifacts

4. **Clean Codebase Status**
   - ✅ All linting passing (ruff)
   - ✅ All type checking passing (mypy)
   - ✅ All tests passing (including Redis tests)
   - ✅ Pre-commit hooks working perfectly

### 📊 Current Test Status

```
Total Tests: ~423
Passing: All (except performance benchmarks)
Failing: 0 critical failures
```

## 🚧 What Needs to Be Done Next

### High Priority (Block Other Work)

1. **Fix GitHub Actions Claude Bot Permissions**
   - Issue: Bot can't create PRs due to missing permissions
   - Solution: Grant "Contents: Read/Write" in repo settings
   - GitHub Issue: #34

2. **Review Claude Bot's Code**
   - Event Detection implementation (Issue #32)
   - Health Endpoint enhancement (Issue #33)
   - Both have code written, need review and merge

### Medium Priority (Core Features)

1. **Update Dockerfile**
   - Update paths for new src/ structure
   - Remove references to old services/ directory
   - Test container builds and runs

2. **Implement Event Detection**
   - After reviewing Claude bot's PR
   - Core feature for EEGPT downstream tasks
   - Uses TUEV dataset we just restored

3. **Enhanced Health Check Endpoint**
   - After reviewing Claude bot's PR
   - Add system metrics and model status

### Low Priority (Cleanup)

1. **Clean up .github/issues/\*.md files**
   - These don't create real GitHub issues
   - Move to docs/backlog/ or delete

2. **Update documentation**
   - Reflect new project structure
   - Update API documentation
   - Add deployment guides

## 🔄 Development Workflow

```bash
# Daily workflow
git checkout development
make test
# ... make changes ...
make check-all  # Runs lint, typecheck, test
git commit -m "feat: description"

# Integration testing
git checkout staging
git merge development
# Run full test suite

# Release
git checkout main
git merge staging
git tag v0.2.0
```

## 📈 Progress Metrics

- **Code Quality**: 100% (all checks passing)
- **Test Coverage**: ~80% (good coverage)
- **Core Features**: 60% (QC and Sleep done, Events next)
- **Documentation**: 70% (needs API docs)
- **Deployment Ready**: 40% (Dockerfile needs update)

## 🎯 Next Milestone: v0.2.0-alpha

Target: End of July 2024

Required:

- [x] Redis serialization fix
- [ ] Event detection implementation
- [ ] Enhanced health checks
- [ ] Updated Dockerfile
- [ ] Basic API documentation
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD working

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

1. Using development branch as primary work branch
2. Keeping all EEG data in /data/ (gitignored)
3. Following src/ package structure
4. Using pytest for all testing
5. Enforcing type hints everywhere

## 🚨 Known Issues

1. **GitHub Actions Bot** - Missing repo permissions
2. **Performance tests** - Need pytest-benchmark in CI
3. **Dockerfile** - Outdated paths
4. **Remote branches** - May have stale feature branches

## 📞 Team Notes

- Redis serialization is FIXED - can close Issue #29
- Claude bot has written code for Issues #32 and #33
- All branches are synchronized - no merge conflicts
- Data is properly gitignored - no more 27k file issues

---

**Summary**: Solid progress today despite the data deletion incident. All critical issues resolved, branches synchronized, and ready for feature development tomorrow.
