# PROJECT STATUS - Brain-Go-Brrr

_Last Updated: August 5, 2025 @ 6:30 PM - v0.6.0 Training Active_

## 🎯 Current State: EEGPT Linear Probe Training

### 🟢 LIVE STATUS: 4-Second Window Training Running

**Session**: `tmux attach -t eegpt_4s_final`
- **Config**: Paper-aligned 4-second windows
- **Target AUROC**: ≥ 0.869 (matching paper performance)
- **Expected Completion**: ~3-4 hours from 6:15 PM
- **Monitor**: `tail -f output/tuab_4s_paper_aligned_20250805_181351/training.log`

### 📊 Production Readiness: 75%

**Verdict: Core ML Pipeline Working, Training for Paper Performance**

## ✅ Major Achievements (August 2025)

### 1. **Critical Discovery: Window Size Matters** 🎯
- **EEGPT was pretrained on 4-second windows**
- 8-second windows only achieve ~0.81 AUROC (insufficient)
- 4-second windows target: 0.869 AUROC (paper performance)
- Complete rewrite of training pipeline for correct window size

### 2. **PyTorch Lightning Bug Workaround** 🐛
- Lightning 2.5.2 hangs with large cached datasets
- Solution: Pure PyTorch implementation (`train_paper_aligned.py`)
- Custom training loop with proper gradient accumulation
- Manual metric tracking and checkpointing

### 3. **Fixed All Training Pipeline Issues** ✅
- Channel mapping: T3→T7, T4→T8, T5→P7, T6→P8
- Variable channel counts handled with custom collate
- Cache index requirements documented
- Environment variable resolution fixed
- Model dimension mismatches resolved

### 4. **Professional Documentation Overhaul** 📚
- Complete experiment documentation in `/experiments/eegpt_linear_probe/`
- TRAINING_STATUS.md with live updates
- ISSUES_AND_FIXES.md with all solutions
- Clean directory structure with archived old attempts

### 5. **Stable Training Infrastructure** 🚀
- tmux session management for persistent training
- Smoke tests before training launches
- Proper logging and monitoring
- Checkpoint saving with best model tracking

## 📊 Training Performance Metrics

| Metric | 8s Windows | 4s Windows (Target) | Status |
|--------|------------|---------------------|---------|
| AUROC | ~0.81 | **0.869** | Training |
| Window Size | 8s | **4s** | ✅ Fixed |
| Batch Size | 32 | 32 | ✅ |
| Learning Rate | 1e-3 | 1e-3 | ✅ |
| Epochs | 200 | 200 | In Progress |

## 🔍 Key Technical Insights

### What We Learned
1. **Window size must match pretraining** (4s for EEGPT)
2. **PyTorch Lightning has critical bugs** with large datasets
3. **Channel mapping is crucial** for TUAB dataset
4. **Cache index files are required** for fast loading
5. **Pure PyTorch is more reliable** than Lightning for research

### Current Architecture
```
Input EEG (4s @ 256Hz) → EEGPT (frozen) → Linear Probe → Binary Classification
     1024 samples          512-dim            2 classes
                          features         (normal/abnormal)
```
