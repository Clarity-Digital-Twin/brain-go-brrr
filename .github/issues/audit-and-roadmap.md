# Audit Current State and Plan Next Steps

## Current Achievement Summary
- ✅ 183/200 tests passing (91.5% pass rate)
- ✅ 85.91% code coverage
- ✅ Redis caching with auto-reconnect implemented
- ✅ Authentication system for protected endpoints
- ✅ EDF streaming integration started (partial)
- ✅ UTC time utilities implemented
- ✅ API health endpoint with version info

## Remaining Critical Items
1. **Fix 17 failing tests** (mostly EDF streaming)
2. **Complete streaming integration** into EEGPT model path
3. **Add Redis to CI pipeline**
4. **Fix 22 mypy type errors**
5. **Performance validation** against requirements

## Next Sprint Priorities (Ordered)
1. **Complete EDF Streaming** (HIGH)
   - Fix remaining test failures
   - Validate 120s threshold logic
   - Test with real large files

2. **Production Readiness** (HIGH)
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Load testing
   - Error recovery validation
   - Memory leak detection

3. **Deployment Preparation** (MEDIUM)
   - Docker configuration
   - Environment variable documentation
   - Deployment scripts
   - Monitoring setup

4. **Feature Completion** (MEDIUM)
   - Sleep analysis integration
   - Event detection implementation
   - Advanced reporting features

## Questions to Address
1. Are we meeting the 2-minute processing target for 20-minute files?
2. Is the 120s streaming threshold optimal?
3. Do we need additional caching strategies?
4. Should we implement job queuing for long-running analyses?
5. What monitoring/alerting do we need for production?

## Recommended Next Session Focus
Start with completing the EDF streaming tests as they're blocking other work. Then move to performance validation to ensure we meet the PRD requirements.

@claude Please audit our current progress and recommend the most strategic next steps for achieving production readiness. Focus on identifying any gaps in our implementation versus the PRD requirements.
