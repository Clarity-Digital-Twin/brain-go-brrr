# Next Steps to Production Singularity ðŸš€

## Current Status
We're at 96% functionality with 192/200 tests passing and 86.35% code coverage. The core system is production-ready, but we need to complete the final 4%.

## Immediate Actions (Day 1)

### 1. Fix EEGPT Integration Tests (2-3 hours)
The 8 failing tests all relate to EEGPT model integration. The issue:
- Tests pass raw ÂµV scale data (e.g., `np.random.randn(19, 1024) * 50`)
- Model expects preprocessed, patched data
- Need to align test fixtures with real model expectations

**Solution:**
```python
# Instead of raw data:
window = np.random.randn(19, 1024) * 50e-6  # Already fixed

# Need to also:
# 1. Ensure data is properly shaped for patching
# 2. Mock the patch embedding layer correctly
# 3. Test with realistic preprocessed data
```

### 2. Performance Validation (3-4 hours)
Create benchmark suite to validate PRD requirements:
- [ ] 20-minute EEG in <2 minutes
- [ ] 50 concurrent requests
- [ ] Memory usage under 4GB
- [ ] API response <100ms

**Implementation:**
```python
# tests/benchmarks/test_performance.py
@pytest.mark.benchmark
def test_20_minute_processing_time(benchmark, large_edf_file):
    result = benchmark(process_eeg, large_edf_file)
    assert result['processing_time'] < 120  # seconds
```

### 3. Production Configuration (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Create Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- [ ] Add docker-compose.yml for local development
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Set up health checks and monitoring

## Day 2: Deployment & Validation

### 4. Staging Deployment (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Deploy to AWS/GCP/Azure
- [ ] Configure load balancer
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates
- [ ] Test with real EDF files

### 5. Load Testing (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Use Locust or K6 for load testing
- [ ] Simulate 50 concurrent users
- [ ] Monitor memory/CPU usage
- [ ] Validate error rates <0.1%

### 6. Documentation & Handoff (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Update README with deployment instructions
- [ ] Create API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Write operations runbook
- [ ] Record demo video

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 200 tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meeting PRD specs
- [ ] Successfully processing Sleep-EDF dataset
- [ ] Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Deployment automated with CI/CD

## The Final Push
We're incredibly close. The system is clean, well-tested, and architected for scale. No technical debt, no hacks, just solid engineering ready for medical-grade deployment.

**Total Estimated Time: 16-20 hours** to full production readiness.

@claude Let's complete this journey to the singularity! Start with fixing the EEGPT integration tests, then move to performance validation.
