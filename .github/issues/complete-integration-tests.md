# Complete Integration Test Suite

## Current Status
We have good unit test coverage (85.91%) but need comprehensive integration tests that validate the full pipeline end-to-end.

## Missing Integration Tests
1. **Full Pipeline Test**
   - Upload EDF → QC Analysis → Abnormality Detection → Report Generation
   - Test with various file sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Verify streaming kicks in for large files

2. **Redis Integration**
   - Cache hits and misses
   - Auto-reconnect during analysis
   - Cache invalidation patterns
   - Concurrent access patterns

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Corrupted EDF handling
   - Network failures during processing
   - Out of memory scenarios
   - Invalid channel configurations

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Large file processing time
   - Memory usage under load
   - Cache effectiveness metrics

## Tasks
- [ ] Create `tests/integration/test_full_pipeline.py`
- [ ] Add fixtures for various EDF file types
- [ ] Test streaming activation thresholds
- [ ] Verify report generation accuracy
- [ ] Test error recovery mechanisms
- [ ] Add load testing scenarios
- [ ] Create performance regression tests

## Test Data Requirements
- Small EDF (< 1 minute)
- Medium EDF (5-10 minutes)
- Large EDF (> 20 minutes)
- Corrupted EDF files
- Various channel configurations

## Priority
High - Essential for production confidence

@claude Please create comprehensive integration tests that validate the full EEG processing pipeline from file upload through report generation, including error scenarios and performance validation.
