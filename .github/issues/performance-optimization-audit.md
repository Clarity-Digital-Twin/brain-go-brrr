# Performance Optimization Audit

## Current Status
We've achieved 85.91% test coverage and have a working system, but need to ensure it meets performance requirements:
- Process 20-minute EEG in <2 minutes
- Support 50 concurrent analyses
- API response time <100ms
- Handle files up to 2GB

## Areas to Audit
1. **EEGPT Model Performance**
   - Batch processing optimization
   - GPU utilization
   - Memory usage during inference
   - Streaming vs full-load decision logic

2. **API Performance**
   - Response time for health checks
   - File upload handling
   - Concurrent request handling
   - Cache hit/miss rates

3. **Memory Management**
   - EDF streaming threshold optimization
   - Window overlap memory efficiency
   - Garbage collection patterns
   - Peak memory usage tracking

## Tasks
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks to test suite
- [ ] Profile EEGPT inference with large files
- [ ] Measure API endpoint response times
- [ ] Test concurrent request handling
- [ ] Optimize batch sizes for GPU inference
- [ ] Add memory usage logging
- [ ] Create performance dashboard

## Benchmarking Plan
1. Create `tests/benchmarks/` directory
2. Add pytest-benchmark tests for key operations
3. Set up performance regression detection
4. Document baseline performance metrics

## Priority
High - Critical for production readiness

@claude Please conduct a performance optimization audit focusing on EEGPT inference speed, API response times, and memory usage patterns. Add benchmarks to track performance over time.
