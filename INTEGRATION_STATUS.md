# Integration Status Summary

## ✅ Completed

### 1. YASA Implementation Audit

- Verified YASA is ML-based (LightGBM)
- Fixed critical preprocessing issue (removed filtering)
- Added confidence score support
- Created comprehensive tests with Sleep-EDF data

### 2. Temporal Smoothing

- Implemented `_smooth_hypnogram()` method
- Added `apply_smoothing` parameter to `stage_sleep()`
- All smoothing tests pass

### 3. Unified EEGPT Feature Extractor

- Created `EEGPTFeatureExtractor` service
- Supports caching for efficiency
- Handles batch processing
- All tests pass (8/8)

### 4. Enhanced YASA with Embeddings (Partial)

- Modified `SleepAnalyzer.stage_sleep()` to accept embeddings
- Added validation for embedding dimensions
- Currently logs usage but falls back to standard YASA

## 🔄 In Progress

### Integration Architecture

- EEGPT embeddings can be passed to YASA
- Validation ensures correct dimensions
- Need to implement actual feature fusion

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Complete Feature Fusion

```python
def _combine_features(self, yasa_features, eegpt_embeddings):
    """Combine YASA and EEGPT features."""
    # 1. Aggregate EEGPT embeddings (7.5 windows → 1 epoch)
    # 2. Concatenate with YASA features
    # 3. Return combined feature vector
```

### 2. Create Integrated Pipeline Class

```python
class IntegratedEEGPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_extractor = EEGPTFeatureExtractor()
        self.sleep_analyzer = SleepAnalyzer()

    def process(self, raw):
        embeddings = self.feature_extractor.extract_embeddings(raw)
        sleep_results = self.sleep_analyzer.stage_sleep(raw, embeddings=embeddings)
        return sleep_results
```

### 3. Performance Benchmarking

- Compare standard YASA vs enhanced with embeddings
- Measure processing time
- Validate on full Sleep-EDF dataset

## 🎯 Architecture Achievement

We've successfully created the foundation for the integrated architecture:

```
Raw EEG → Preprocessing → EEGPT Feature Extractor → Embeddings
                                   ↓
                          SleepAnalyzer.stage_sleep(embeddings=...)
                                   ↓
                            Enhanced Sleep Staging
```

The key integration points are in place:

1. ✅ EEGPT extracts features once
2. ✅ Features can be shared with YASA
3. ⏳ Feature fusion for enhanced predictions (placeholder)
4. ✅ No orphan code - everything connects

## 🚀 To Complete Integration

1. Implement actual feature fusion in `sleep_metrics.py`
2. Create ensemble classifier using both feature sets
3. Add cross-task information flow (sleep → abnormality)
4. Benchmark improvements on Sleep-EDF

The architecture is ready for true integration - YASA and EEGPT are no longer isolated services!
