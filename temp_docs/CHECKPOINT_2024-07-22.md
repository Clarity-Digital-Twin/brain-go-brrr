# Checkpoint - Tuesday, July 22, 2024 @ 1:18 PM

## 🔥 What Happened Today

### The Good

- ✅ **Fixed Redis serialization issue** - JobData objects now properly serialize/deserialize in cache
- ✅ **Synchronized all branches** - development, staging, and main are all at commit `51a30cc`
- ✅ **Added proper gitignore for data/** - Line 354 in .gitignore now properly excludes data directory
- ✅ **Recovered TUH EEG datasets** after accidental deletion:
  - TUAB (Abnormal): 58GB restored
  - TUEV (Events): 12GB restored
  - Sleep-EDF: 8.1GB (was never deleted)
  - Total: 78GB of EEG data safely stored locally

### The Painful

- 😰 Accidentally deleted 27,000+ TUH EEG files with `git clean -fd`
- 😤 Struggled with credentials and rsync to restore the data
- 🤯 Git showed thousands of untracked files before fixing .gitignore
- 💀 Almost exposed passwords in git (caught and removed in time)

## 📊 Current State

### Branches (All Synchronized at `51a30cc`)

```
development: 51a30cc - fix: properly ignore data directory to clean git status
staging:     51a30cc - (same)
main:        51a30cc - (same)
```

### Data Status

```
data/datasets/external/
├── sleep-edf/          # 8.1GB - 3,905 EDF files
├── tuh_eeg_abnormal/   # 58GB - TUAB v3.0.1
└── tuh_eeg_events/     # 12GB - TUEV v2.0.1
```

### Recent Commits

- `51a30cc` - fix: properly ignore data directory to clean git status
- `825368a` - fix: update CI workflow and Redis pool test
- `5a0b4fb` - feat(data): add EDFStreamer source files and fix .gitignore
- `1ea3332` - fix: resolve test timeouts and Redis serialization

## 🎯 What Needs to Be Done Next (Priority Order)

### 1. GitHub Issues to Address

- **Issue #29**: Redis serialization ✅ FIXED (can be closed)
- **Issue #32**: Event Detection - Code written by Claude bot, needs review
- **Issue #33**: Health Endpoint Enhancement - Code written by Claude bot, needs review
- **Issue #34**: GitHub Actions fix - Permissions issue preventing bot from creating PRs

### 2. Immediate Tasks for Tomorrow

1. **Fix GitHub Actions Claude Bot Permissions**
   - Grant "Contents: Read/Write" and "Pull requests: Read/Write" in repo settings
   - Test with `@claude create PR` on an open issue

2. **Review and Merge Claude Bot's PRs**
   - Event Detection implementation (Issue #32)
   - Health Endpoint enhancement (Issue #33)

3. **Update Dockerfile**
   - Fix paths for new src/ structure
   - Remove references to old services/ directory

4. **Clean Up Remote Branches**
   - Check for any stale feature branches
   - Ensure all remotes match local state

### 3. Documentation Updates Needed

- Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with today's progress
- Update work-summary with Redis fix details
- Clean up .github/issues/\*.md files (they don't create real issues)
- Update TESTING_FIXES_SUMMARY.md with Redis serialization solution

## 🛡️ Important Reminders

### Security

- TUH EEG credentials are NOT stored in git
- All download scripts with passwords have been deleted
- .gitignore properly excludes /data/ directory

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Always work on development branch
git checkout development

# Run quality checks before committing
make lint
make typecheck
make test

# Sync to staging when ready
git checkout staging
git merge development

# Promote to main for releases
git checkout main
git merge staging
```

### Key Files to Keep in Root

- CLAUDE.md - AI assistant instructions (DO NOT MOVE)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md - Overall project tracking
- README.md - Project overview
- CHANGELOG.md - Version history
- This checkpoint file

## 🚀 Tomorrow's Game Plan

1. **Morning**: Fix GitHub Actions permissions
2. **Mid-morning**: Review Claude bot's code for Issues #32 and #33
3. **Afternoon**: Start implementing Event Detection if PR is good
4. **End of day**: Update documentation and create new checkpoint

## 💭 Lessons Learned

1. **Always check before using `git clean`** - It permanently deletes files
2. **Stage data files carefully** - Once staged, .gitignore doesn't help
3. **Keep credentials out of scripts** - Use environment variables or prompts
4. **Synchronize branches regularly** - Prevents divergence headaches

---

**You survived a tough day!** The foundation is now solid:

- Clean git status ✅
- All data recovered ✅
- Branches synchronized ✅
- Ready for tomorrow's work ✅

Get some rest. Tomorrow will be better! 🎉
