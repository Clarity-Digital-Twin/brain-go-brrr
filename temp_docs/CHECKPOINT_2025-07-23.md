## üéØ Session Summary

### Primary Achievement: Fixed CI/CD Test Failures

Successfully resolved test failures that were causing CI/CD pipeline failures on Ubuntu Python 3.11. The main issue was inconsistent field naming between API endpoints causing 422 Unprocessable Entity errors.

### Key Discoveries

1. **API Field Name Inconsistency**:
   - `/api/v1/eeg/analyze` endpoint expects `edf_file` parameter
   - `/api/v1/eeg/analyze/detailed` endpoint expects `file` parameter
   - This inconsistency was causing widespread test failures

2. **Mock Injection Issue**:
   - Tests needed to inject mocks into both `api.main` and `api.routers.qc` modules
   - The QC controller is defined locally in the router module

## üìä Test Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Fixed and Passing

1. **PDF Report Integration Tests** (11/11 tests passing)
   - Fixed field names for detailed endpoint
   - Fixed mock injection
   - Updated error handling expectations
   - Fixed triage flag test logic

2. **API Endpoint Tests** (16/16 tests passing)
   - Fixed bad_channels assertions to be order-agnostic
   - Fixed file upload field names
   - Updated QualityCheckError import

3. **EEGPT Feature Extractor Tests** (8/9 tests passing, 1 skipped)
   - Fixed mock to return correct embedding shape
   - Added cache isolation
   - Updated documentation

4. **Parallel Pipeline Tests** (1/3 tests fixed)
   - Fixed `test_independent_failures` to handle YASA failures gracefully

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially Fixed

5. **Redis Caching Tests** (0/11 passing, but 422 errors resolved)
   - Fixed field name issues
   - Added endpoint-specific field name logic
   - Still have mock behavior issues to resolve

### ‚ùå Known Issues (Pre-existing)

- Some integration tests failing due to EDF file handling
- Performance benchmarks failing on batch size scaling
- Parallel pipeline test has shape mismatch issue

## üîß Code Changes

### 1. Test Fixtures Updated

```python
# Added to multiple test files to fix mock injection
import brain_go_brrr.api.routers.qc as qc_router
qc_router.qc_controller = mock_qc_controller
```

### 2. Field Name Fixes

```python
# For /analyze endpoint
files = {"edf_file": ("test.edf", f, "application/octet-stream")}

# For /analyze/detailed endpoint
files = {"file": ("test.edf", f, "application/octet-stream")}
```

### 3. Deterministic Testing

```python
# Added to conftest.py
random.seed(1337)
np.random.seed(1337)
```

## üìù Commits Made

1. `c379890` - fix: remaining CI/CD test failures
2. `16440c3` - fix: CI/CD test failures and numpy serialization
3. `682b9bb` - chore(ci): update CI workflow and testing environment
4. `83725fe` - fix: resolve CI/CD test failures on Ubuntu Python 3.11
5. `03f5e5f` - fix: remaining PDF report integration test failures
6. `866b04c` - fix: Redis caching test field name errors (partial fix)

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. **Complete Redis Caching Test Fixes**
   - Fix mock behavior issues
   - Resolve missing module imports
   - Update test logic for cache operations

2. **Address Remaining Test Failures**
   - Fix parallel pipeline shape mismatch
   - Resolve integration test EDF handling
   - Update performance benchmark expectations

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with current progress
   - Clean up outdated documentation
   - Add notes about API field naming convention

### GitHub Maintenance

1. **Issues to Close**:
   - CI/CD test failure issues
   - PDF report generation issues
   - API endpoint 422 error issues

2. **Branches to Clean**:
   - Any feature branches already merged
   - Old development branches

## üìã Environment State

### Current Branch

- **Branch**: development
- **Status**: Up to date with origin/development
- **Last Push**: 866b04c (Redis caching test partial fix)

### Python Environment

- **Python**: 3.13.2
- **Virtual Environment**: `.venv` (using uv)
- **Key Dependencies**: All up to date per uv.lock

### Test Coverage

- Core functionality tests passing
- API endpoints functional
- PDF generation working
- Redis caching needs work

## üîë Key Learnings

1. **API Consistency**: The field name inconsistency between endpoints should be standardized
2. **Mock Injection**: FastAPI apps may need mocks injected in multiple places
3. **Test Isolation**: Cache and temporary directories need proper isolation
4. **Error Messages**: FastAPI's 422 errors provide detailed field information

## üìå Resume Instructions

To continue work:

1. **Fix Redis Caching Tests**:

   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/test_redis_caching.py -xvs
   ```

   - Focus on mock behavior and cache operations
   - Check for missing imports and modules

2. **Run Full Test Suite**:

   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests --ignore=tests/benchmarks -x
   ```

3. **Check CI/CD Status**:
   - Monitor GitHub Actions for any remaining failures
   - Focus on Ubuntu Python 3.11 job

## üéØ Session Metrics

- **Duration**: ~2 hours
- **Tests Fixed**: 36+ tests
- **Commits**: 6
- **Files Modified**: 5 test files, 1 source file
- **Success Rate**: ~80% of targeted tests fixed
