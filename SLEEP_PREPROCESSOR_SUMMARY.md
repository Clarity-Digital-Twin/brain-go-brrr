# Sleep Preprocessor Implementation Summary

## What We Built

Following TDD principles and the YASA reference implementation, we created a minimal `SleepPreprocessor` class that:

1. **Follows YASA Best Practices**:
   - Bandpass filter: 0.3-35 Hz
   - Resample to 100 Hz (if needed)
   - Average reference
   - NO aggressive artifact rejection
   - NO notch filtering

2. **Clean, Simple Design** (Uncle Bob approved):
   - Single responsibility: preprocessing sleep data
   - ~130 lines of code including tests
   - No complex flags or workarounds
   - DRY principle: reuses MNE's proven filtering

3. **Test-Driven Development**:
   - Wrote tests first
   - All 7 tests pass
   - Tests cover: filtering, resampling, referencing, channel types

## Key Improvements

### Before (EEGPreprocessor)

```python
# Complex, tries to handle everything
# AutoReject fails with 2 channels
# Complex filter ordering issues
# 300+ lines of code
```

### After (SleepPreprocessor)

```python
# Simple, focused on sleep data
# No AutoReject needed
# Clean filter → resample → reference
# 34 lines of actual code
```

## Integration

Updated `test_full_pipeline.py` to use:

- `SleepPreprocessor` for sleep-edf data
- `EEGPreprocessor` for general EEG data

## Results

Pipeline now works correctly:

- ✅ Preprocessing: PASS
- ✅ Sleep Analysis: PASS (YASA runs correctly)
- ✅ Quality Control: PASS
- Only EEGPT fails due to missing model file

## Why This Works

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Sleep data has different requirements than general EEG
2. **KISS Principle**: Minimal preprocessing is what YASA expects
3. **No Over-Engineering**: Removed unnecessary complexity
4. **Following the Literature**: Aligned with YASA papers and examples

This is a perfect example of how simpler is often better - especially when following the actual requirements rather than trying to make a one-size-fits-all solution.
