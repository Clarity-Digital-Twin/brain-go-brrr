# CRASH REPORT - train_pytorch_stable.py

## CRITICAL: This script CRASHED overnight after only 171 batches!

### Crash Details
- **Date**: August 4, 2025 00:04 - 01:15 AM
- **Progress**: Only 171/29078 batches (0.6% of epoch 0)
- **Last known metrics**: acc=60.64%, loss=0.5918
- **Log file**: logs/training_20250804_000405.log (only 39 lines)

### Why It Crashed
1. **NO NaN protection** - This version lacks all the safety features
2. **No gradient clipping** - Gradients can explode
3. **No input validation** - Doesn't check for bad data
4. **No anomaly detection** - Can't catch numerical instabilities
5. **Higher learning rate** - More prone to instability

### What This Means
**DO NOT USE THIS SCRIPT FOR REAL TRAINING!**

This "stable" version is ironically unstable because it has zero protection against:
- NaN/Inf values in loss
- Gradient explosions
- Bad batches in the dataset
- Numerical overflow/underflow

### Solution
Use `train_pytorch_nan_safe.py` which has:
- Comprehensive NaN detection
- Gradient clipping (norm=1.0)
- Learning rate warmup
- Input validation
- Anomaly detection for debugging
- Safe numerical operations

### Lesson Learned
"Stable" doesn't mean shit without proper numerical safeguards. The "nan_safe" version is the ONLY reliable training script.
