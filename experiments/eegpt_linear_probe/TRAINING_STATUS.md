# EEGPT Linear Probe Training Status

## 🟢 Current Status: TRAINING SUCCESSFULLY

As of: August 4, 2025 08:25 AM

### Current Metrics
- **Epoch**: 0 (20% complete - 5763/29077 batches)
- **Accuracy**: 62.5% (improved from 52%)
- **Loss**: 0.656 (decreasing steadily)
- **Speed**: ~9.5 iterations/second
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 (12GB VRAM usage)

### Training Command
```bash
tmux attach -t eegpt_nan_safe
```

## ✅ What's Working

1. **NaN Protection**: No NaN issues detected
2. **Gradient Clipping**: Working (occasional warnings handled)
3. **Learning Rate Warmup**: Started at 2e-6, warming up
4. **Data Loading**: Fast cached dataset (930k samples)
5. **Memory Usage**: Stable at ~12GB VRAM

## 📈 Progress Timeline

- **08:13 AM**: Training started
- **08:14 AM**: First epoch began, 52% initial accuracy
- **08:25 AM**: 20% through epoch 0, 62.5% accuracy
- **Expected completion**: ~10-12 hours for 50 epochs

## 🔧 Configuration That Works

```yaml
# Key settings preventing NaN:
batch_size: 32
learning_rate: 2e-4 (with warmup)
gradient_clip: 1.0
num_workers: 2
precision: 32 (fp32)
window_duration: 8.0 seconds
sampling_rate: 256 Hz
```

## 📊 Expected Results

Based on literature:
- **Target AUROC**: ≥ 0.93
- **Target Balanced Accuracy**: > 80%
- **Current trajectory**: Looking good!

## 🚨 What NOT to Do

1. **DO NOT use PyTorch Lightning** - It will hang
2. **DO NOT set num_workers=0** - Causes persistent_workers bug
3. **DO NOT use mixed precision** initially - Can cause NaN
4. **DO NOT skip gradient clipping** - Essential for stability

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Let training complete (10-12 hours)
2. Monitor for any NaN issues (unlikely now)
3. Evaluate on test set
4. Save best checkpoint for inference

## 🔍 Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Live training view
tmux attach -t eegpt_nan_safe

# Quick metrics check
tail -f logs/nan_safe_training_*/training.log | grep -E "loss|acc|grad"

# GPU monitoring
watch -n 1 nvidia-smi
```

## 💾 Output Location

- **Checkpoints**: `output/nan_safe_run_*/`
- **Logs**: `logs/nan_safe_training_*/`
- **Best model**: Will be saved as `best_model.pt`

**Remember**: This is the first successful training run after fixing all issues. DO NOT interrupt unless absolutely necessary!
