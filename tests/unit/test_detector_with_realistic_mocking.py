"""SKIPPED: Over-engineered ML model mocking (Anti-pattern).

This test file attempts to mock EEGPT model behavior in detail, which violates
ML testing best practices:

1. Complex mocks don't capture real ML model complexity
2. Produces nearly identical scores (~1e-12 difference) making tests meaningless
3. High maintenance overhead and brittle to changes
4. False confidence - passes but doesn't test real integration

BETTER APPROACH:
- Use real EEG data fixtures in tests/fixtures/eeg/ (9 files available)
- Test business logic separately from ML model predictions
- Use integration tests with actual EEGPT model on small data samples

See docs/TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md for detailed guidance.
