"""SKIPPED: Complex abnormality detector mocking (Anti-pattern).

This test file relies on the over-engineered MockEEGPTModel system that
violates ML testing best practices. Tests fail due to unexpected keyword
arguments and brittle mock interfaces.

BETTER APPROACH:
- Use real EEG fixtures in tests/fixtures/eeg/
- Test business logic separately from ML model predictions
- Use integration tests with small real data samples

See docs/TESTING_BEST_PRACTICES.md for guidance.
