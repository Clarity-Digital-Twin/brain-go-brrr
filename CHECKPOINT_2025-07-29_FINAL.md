# ðŸš€ Daily Checkpoint - July 29, 2025 (FINAL)

## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: EEGPT Summary Tokens Fixed!

### What We Accomplished Today

1. **âœ… Fixed All Redis Cache Tests**
   - Implemented proper dependency injection with FastAPI
   - All 9 Redis tests now passing cleanly
   - No more hacky xfails or mocks

2. **âœ… Deep Fixed Test Suite**
   - Eliminated all silent failures
   - Removed inappropriate xfails
   - Tests now test actual behavior, not mocks

3. **âœ… DISCOVERED AND FIXED EEGPT's Core Bug**
   - **Problem**: We were averaging all features instead of using summary tokens
   - **Solution**: Properly implemented the 4 learnable summary tokens from the paper
   - **Impact**: Features now discriminate between different EEG patterns!

4. **âœ… Implemented Linear Probe Architecture**
   - Created `LinearProbeHead` base class
   - Specialized probes for Sleep, Abnormality, Motor Imagery
   - All 15 linear probe tests passing

## ðŸ“Š Technical Details

### The Summary Token Fix

**Before (WRONG):**

```python
# Averaging everything - destroys all information!
summary_features = features.mean(dim=(0, 1))
summary_features = summary_features.expand(4, -1)  # Just 4 copies
```

**After (CORRECT):**

```python
# Added learnable summary tokens to architecture
self.summary_token = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1, embed_num, embed_dim))

# Concatenate to input sequence
x = torch.cat([x, summary_tokens], dim=1)

# Extract only summary tokens after transformer
x = x[:, -self.embed_num:, :]
```

### Results

- Cosine similarity between different patterns: 0.3-0.5 (was 1.0!)
- All 4 summary tokens are unique (were identical)
- Features actually encode EEG patterns now

## ðŸ“ˆ Test Status

```
âœ… 26 new tests added and passing:
   - 9 summary token tests
   - 15 linear probe tests
   - 2 extreme discrimination tests

âœ… All existing tests still passing
âœ… Linting mostly clean (minor issues remain)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Tomorrow's Tasks

1. **Create Mini Training Script for Sleep-EDF**
   - We have the data (197 subjects)
   - Linear probe is ready
   - Just need training loop

2. **Wire Linear Probe into API**
   - Add sleep staging endpoint
   - Integrate with existing abnormality detection

3. **Benchmark End-to-End Performance**
   - Test on real Sleep-EDF data
   - Measure inference speed
   - Compare to paper's results

## ðŸ’¡ Key Insights

1. **We had the weights all along** - The 973MB checkpoint was valid
2. **The bug was architectural** - Not a training issue
3. **Linear probing is cheap** - Only train 2048â†’N parameters
4. **Summary tokens are the secret** - They aggregate information across the entire sequence

## ðŸš€ Path Forward

With summary tokens fixed, we can now:

- Train task-specific linear probes with minimal compute
- Achieve the accuracy levels reported in the paper
- Have a working MVP within days, not months

**Time spent today**: ~8 hours
**ROI**: Turned random outputs into meaningful features

_"We were trying to average our way to glory when EEGPT already provided summary tokens. Time to use the model as designed!"_
