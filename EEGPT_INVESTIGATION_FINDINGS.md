# EEGPT Investigation Findings - The Brutal Truth

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line: We have a feature extractor, NOT a working product.**

The 973MB EEGPT checkpoint loads and runs, but it's just a pretrained encoder that extracts features from EEG data. The actual value-generating capabilities (abnormality detection, sleep staging, event detection) are either missing or completely untrained.

## What Actually Works ✅

1. **Checkpoint Loading**
   - The 973MB model checkpoint loads successfully
   - Contains 413 parameters in the state dict
   - Uses Vision Transformer architecture with 12 blocks

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - EEGPT encoder runs without errors
   - Extracts 512-dimensional features from 4-second EEG windows
   - Processes data at 256 Hz sampling rate
   - Handles up to 58 channels

3. **Data Processing**
   - Can load and preprocess EDF files
   - Supports streaming for large files
   - Works with Sleep-EDF dataset

4. **Infrastructure**
   - FastAPI skeleton exists
   - Basic API endpoints defined
   - MNE integration working

## What Doesn't Work ❌

1. **Abnormality Detection**
   - The abnormality detection head is RANDOMLY INITIALIZED
   - Has never been trained on abnormal vs normal EEG data
   - Predictions are essentially random (50/50 chance)
   - Weight statistics confirm random initialization:
     ```
     Layer weights: mean=-0.000, std=0.013 (typical for random init)
     ```

2. **Feature Discrimination**
   - Features are NOT discriminative between different signal types
   - Cosine similarity between different signals: ~1.000 (identical!)
   - Pure alpha waves, beta waves, and white noise produce nearly identical features
   - This suggests the encoder may not be properly extracting meaningful EEG patterns

3. **Sleep Staging**
   - No implementation exists
   - Would need to build and train from scratch

4. **Event Detection**
   - No implementation exists
   - Would need to build and train from scratch

## Technical Findings

### Model Architecture

```
Encoder: EEGTransformer with 12 transformer blocks
- Patch embedding: 64 samples (250ms at 256Hz)
- Channel embedding: Up to 58 channels
- Hidden dimension: 512
- Summary tokens: 4

Abnormality Head: Sequential(
  Linear(2048 → 512)
  ReLU()
  Dropout(0.2)
  Linear(512 → 2)  # Binary classification
)
```

### Feature Extraction Test Results

When testing different signal types:

- Pure 10Hz alpha wave → Features: mean=0.001, std=1.398
- Pure 20Hz beta wave → Features: mean=0.001, std=1.398
- White noise → Features: mean=0.001, std=1.398
- Flat line → Features: mean=0.001, std=1.398

**All signals produce virtually identical features!**

### Performance on Real Data

- Successfully processed Sleep-EDF files
- Can handle 23+ hour recordings (with streaming)
- But predictions are meaningless due to untrained classifier

## Commercial Viability Assessment 💰

### Current State: $0 Product

- Cannot detect abnormalities (main value proposition)
- Cannot perform sleep staging (key feature)
- Cannot detect epileptiform events
- No validated clinical performance

### What's Needed to Make Money

1. **Immediate Requirements**
   - Labeled dataset of normal vs abnormal EEG (minimum 10,000 recordings)
   - Training pipeline for abnormality detection head
   - Validation on clinical data
   - FDA/regulatory pathway planning

2. **Development Effort**
   - 2-3 months to collect/prepare training data
   - 1 month to train and validate abnormality detection
   - 2 months for sleep staging implementation
   - 2 months for event detection
   - 3+ months for clinical validation

3. **Data Requirements**
   - Abnormal EEG dataset (epilepsy, artifacts, pathological patterns)
   - Sleep-scored polysomnography data (already have Sleep-EDF)
   - Event-annotated EEG (spike-wave, sharp waves, etc.)

## The Brutal Truth 🚨

1. **We bought a car engine, not a car**
   - EEGPT is just the encoder (engine)
   - All the valuable parts (steering wheel, brakes, etc.) are missing

2. **The "abnormality detection" is fake**
   - It's just random predictions with a confidence score
   - No actual training on abnormal patterns

3. **Features might be broken**
   - Different EEG patterns produce identical features
   - Suggests the pretrained model may not transfer well to our use case

4. **Minimum 6 months to MVP**
   - Need significant data collection
   - Need actual model training
   - Need clinical validation

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Pivot to What Works

- Use YASA for sleep staging (87% accuracy out of the box)
- Use Autoreject for quality control (proven to work)
- Skip EEGPT entirely for now

### Option 2: Commit to Training

- Budget $100-200k for data acquisition
- Hire clinical EEG expert for annotation
- 6-month development timeline
- High risk, potentially high reward

### Option 3: Find a Different Model

- Look for models with pretrained task heads
- Consider commercial EEG analysis APIs
- Evaluate other open-source options

## Code Evidence

From our testing:

```python
# Testing abnormality head with different inputs
Random features -> Normal: 0.515, Abnormal: 0.485
Zero features -> Normal: 0.489, Abnormal: 0.511
# Nearly 50/50 split = random predictions

# Feature similarity between different signals
Cosine similarity alpha vs beta: 1.000
Cosine similarity alpha vs noise: 1.000
# Identical features = no discrimination
```

## Conclusion

**We have infrastructure, not intelligence.** The EEGPT model is a feature extractor that needs significant additional work to provide any commercial value. Without proper training data and 6+ months of development, this is a $0 product.

The fastest path to revenue would be to abandon EEGPT and use proven tools like YASA for sleep staging and Autoreject for QC, which actually work out of the box.
