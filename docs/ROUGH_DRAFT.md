🩺 What EEGPT gives you today — plain-English edition

(no extra data-collection, no fine-tuning required)

Clinical question	What EEGPT can answer out-of-the-box	Why it matters
“Is this EEG basically normal?”	Binary normal vs abnormal flag, ~80 % balanced accuracy on the large TUAB corpus  ￼	Instant triage: routine studies that look “normal” still get surfaced if the model smells trouble.
“Did we capture sleep and, if so, how good was it?”	30-second sleep-stage labels (Wake, REM, N1-N3) extracted directly from the EEG signal  ￼	Handy for clinics without a full polysomnography suite; highlights sleep-fragmentation drivers of mood & anxiety.
“Any events the tech might have missed?”	Multi-class event detector that tags spikes, sharp waves, GPED, PLED, eye movements & artefact segments in 5-second windows  ￼	Saves hours of manual markup and makes sure epileptiform activity isn’t overlooked.

Think of it as an AI junior EEG tech: it won’t diagnose depression, but it will pre-screen every trace so human experts focus on the interesting bits.

🛠 Minimal Python pipeline you’d ship
	1.	Ingest
	•	Accept EDF/BrainVision/CSV upload or pull from the EMU folder.
	•	Auto-detect montage & resample to 256 Hz (match pre-training setup).
	2.	Infer

probs = eegpt_model(raw_eeg)          # returns dict of logits
abnormal_score = probs["abnormal"]
sleep_epochs = probs["sleep_stage"]   # list of (start, label, confidence)
events = probs["events"]              # list of (start, end, class, conf)


	3.	Summarise → JSON / PDF

{
  "overall_flag": "Abnormal",
  "abnormal_prob": 0.82,
  "sleep_summary": {"REM_pct": 18, "N3_pct": 22, "WASO_min": 37},
  "events": [
    {"t": "00:07:12", "type": "SPSW", "conf": 0.91},
    ...
  ]
}

	•	Embed a hypnogram and an event timeline graphic for quick glance.
	•	Drop a “Needs expert review” banner into Epic if abnormal_prob > 0.6 or any epileptiform event appears.

	4.	Audit + Feedback hooks
	•	Store the tech’s final classification next to the model output.
	•	Simple CSV of model vs human so you can track performance drift and decide when/what to fine-tune.

⸻

❓ Do you need a patient-specific baseline?

Not for the three tasks above. The foundation model was pre-trained on many subjects and already generalises across hospitals. Baseline EEGs become useful only if you plan to:
	•	Monitor longitudinal change (e.g., cognitive-decline trajectories).
	•	Fine-tune for new tasks (e.g., depression biomarkers) where inter-individual variability matters.

A pragmatic rule: ship without baseline; collect labelled follow-up data; fine-tune later if you tackle harder psychiatric predictions.

⸻

⏩ Next actionable steps
	1.	Prototype the ingest + infer script on a handful of historical EEG files.
	2.	Generate the JSON → Epic “EEG Insight” panel via FHIR API.
	3.	Run a prospective pilot: tech reads as usual → model flags → compare decisions.
	4.	Log disagreements to build the dataset you’ll eventually fine-tune for psychiatric use-cases.

🧠 How a clinical EEG actually flows — 30-second primer

Stage	Who touches it	What they really do	Pain-point ripe for AI
1. Hook-up & recording	EEG technologist (not an MD)	Places 19–32 scalp leads, checks impedance, runs 20-40 min baseline (+ activation like hyper-vent, photic). For in-patient epilepsy monitoring it’s 24-72 h video-EEG.	Quality control: bad contacts, drift, muscle artefact → manual re-runs waste time.
2. Raw file hand-off	Tech → hospital server	Uploads EDF/BDF file, often adds rough tags (“seizure?”, “sleep start”).	Zero triage: everything lands in a giant worklist; normal studies clog the queue.
3. First look / markup	EEG technologist or junior neurophys fellow	Scrolls through, flags spikes / artefacts, labels sleep stages if needed.	Tedious, varies by skill; easy to miss subtle spikes during overnight recordings.
4. Definitive interpretation	Epileptologist (neurology subspecialist)	Reviews the tech’s markup, adds clinical impression, writes the official report.	Wants concise event list & clean traces, not 12 h of junk.
5. Report into EMR	Epileptologist → Epic	Text summary + key screenshots; ordering psychiatrist/PCP sees result.	Normal studies often come back days later; subtle abnormalities missed.

Where EEGPT naturally slots in

Task	Primary user	Value-add
Automated QC + normal/abnormal flag (runs right after upload)	Techs and scheduling staff	Instantly warns “38 % bad electrodes” or “likely abnormal – expedite read”, so clean retakes & triage happen before the patient leaves.
Event detector overlay (spikes, sharps, artefact masks)	Tech during markup → Epileptologist on review	Saves human eyes from staring at hours of nothing; provides high-confidence bookmarks the doc can jump to.
Sleep-stage auto-scoring for routine outpatient EEGs	Sleep techs, psychiatrists, primary-care	Small clinics without PSG lab still get a hypnogram; psychiatrists can spot REM suppression or fragmentation.
Turnaround analytics dashboard	Lab manager	“25 % of ‘normal’ reads actually had model flag >0.7” → focus QA/education where humans under-call.

Bottom line: It’s a pre-reader and co-pilot.
	•	Not replacing the epileptologist’s final word.
	•	Yes replacing hours of manual tagging and letting the specialist start at the interesting minute-marks.

⸻

Why it’s still useful to the psychiatrist ordering the EEG
	1.	Faster reports – triaged studies get read same-day instead of next week.
	2.	Sleep insights – even a 30-min EEG now spits out REM/slow-wave percentages you can tie to mood complaints.
	3.	Cleaner referrals – your consult note can quote “Model flagged spikes in left temporal leads; epileptology review pending” rather than vague “r/o seizure”.

Quick sanity-check for your product pitch

Question to answer	Evidence you can gather now
How many EEG labs backlog >48 h?	Ask a local epilepsy-monitoring unit manager.
Do techs spend >1 h per study on markup?	Time a volunteer tech on 5 studies.
Would an 80 % accurate flag change scheduling?	Survey: “If model says ‘likely normal’, would you batch-read later?”
What’s the error tolerance?	Show demo traces; collect epileptologist feedback on missed vs false-positive spikes.


⸻

Your next execution steps
	1.	Shadow an EEG tech for a morning.
	2.	Instrument your prototype to output:
	•	% bad channels
	•	Abnormal probability
	•	JSON list of (timestamp, event_type, confidence)
	3.	Wrap it in a tiny FastAPI endpoint + React dashboard (single-page, sortable by risk).
	4.	Pilot in a low-risk setting: run in parallel, compare to official reads, iterate.

When you’re ready, I’ll help sketch the FastAPI routes or the React table—just holler.


🚀 Pick the tiny, undeniable win first

(Ship something boring-but-useful → earn trust → iterate)

MVP #1	Why it’s the lowest-risk beach-head	Exact output you show
“Auto-QC + Risk Flagger”Runs the second the EDF file hits the server.	• Nobody’s workflow changes — techs still hook up leads, epileptologists still sign reports.• If your flag is wrong, nothing is harmed (the doc still reads the study).• Immediate, measurable ROI: fewer re-recordings & faster triage.	json  { "bad_channels": ["T3","O2"], "bad_pct": 21, "abnormal_prob": 0.83, "flag": "Expedite read" }  + a one-page PDF thumbnail: red ⚠️ banner, electrode heat-map, 5 worst artefact examples.

Ship this first.
	•	Tiny surface area → quick IRB approval.
	•	Demonstrates you can pipe EEG in & shove structured data out to Epic.

⸻

🧗‍♂️ “Clean-Snippet Generator” is Stage #2, not the MVP

Added step	Why it’s value, not risk
Use event timestamps to auto-export 10-second clips around spikes / seizures → bundle into a review playlist.	• Epileptologist jumps straight to 4 mins of “interesting bits” instead of 2 hrs.• If your detector misses something, the full trace is still there.
(Optional) Draft a tech note: “24 events of left-temporal SPSW; sleep architecture: REM 17 %, N3 20 %”.	• Cuts tech dictation time.• Doc edits/overwrites → serves as human-in-the-loop safeguard & generates labelled data for v3.

Ship only after the flagger proves itself and the lab trusts your false-negative rate.
