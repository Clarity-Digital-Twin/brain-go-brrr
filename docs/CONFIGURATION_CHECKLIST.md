# Configuration Verification Checklist

## ‚úÖ Environment Setup
- [x] Python 3.11+ verified (actually 3.13.2)
- [x] Virtual environment created with `uv`
- [x] All dependencies installed via `uv sync`
- [x] GPU support available (check with `python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"`)

## ‚úÖ Project Structure
- [x] Source code in `src/brain_go_brrr/`
- [x] Tests in `tests/`
- [x] Documentation in `docs/`
- [x] Data directories created
- [x] Model file moved to correct location

## ‚úÖ Model Setup
- [x] EEGPT model at `/data/models/pretrained/eegpt_mcae_58chs_4s_large4E.ckpt`
- [ ] Model weights verified (need to test loading)
- [ ] GPU memory adequate (16GB recommended)

## ‚úÖ Documentation
- [x] PRD - Product Requirements Document
- [x] TRD - Technical Requirements Document
- [x] BDD - Behavior Specifications
- [x] Literature Master Reference
- [x] AI Agent Guidelines
- [x] Tech Stack Document
- [x] Development Standards
- [x] Project Status (current state)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration Files
- [x] `pyproject.toml` - Package configuration
- [x] `Makefile` - Development commands
- [x] `.gitignore` - Properly configured
- [x] `LICENSE` - Apache 2.0
- [ ] `.env.example` - Need to create
- [ ] `config/` directory - Need to populate

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Quality Tools
- [x] Ruff - Linting configured
- [x] Black - Formatting configured
- [x] mypy - Type checking configured
- [x] pytest - Testing configured
- [x] pre-commit - Hooks configured
- [ ] Run initial quality checks

## ‚ùå Missing Components
- [ ] API implementation (FastAPI)
- [ ] Database schema implementation
- [ ] Docker configuration
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Monitoring setup

## üîç Verification Commands

```bash
# Check Python version
uv run python --version  # Should be 3.11+

# Check installations
uv run pip list | grep -E "torch|mne|fastapi|numpy"

# Test imports
uv run python -c "import mne, torch, numpy as np; print('Core imports OK')"

# Check model file
ls -la data/models/pretrained/eegpt_mcae_58chs_4s_large4E.ckpt

# Run linting
uv run ruff check src/

# Run type checking
uv run mypy src/

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```

## üìã Pre-Development Checklist

### Before Writing Code:
1. [ ] Read `/docs/ROUGH_DRAFT.md` for practical approach
2. [ ] Review `/docs/literature-master-reference.md` for technical details
3. [ ] Check `/.claude/guidelines.md` for AI coding standards
4. [ ] Understand service examples in `/services/`
5. [ ] Review reference implementations in `/reference_repos/`

### Before First Commit:
1. [ ] Test model loading works
2. [ ] Verify GPU acceleration
3. [ ] Run all quality checks
4. [ ] Create `.env` from example
5. [ ] Test one service end-to-end

## üö¶ Ready to Code?

### Green Light Criteria:
- ‚úÖ Model file in place
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Documentation complete
- ‚úÖ Structure organized
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to test model loading
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to create config files

### Current Status: **ALMOST READY**

**Next Steps:**
1. Create `/config/pipeline_config.yaml`
2. Create `.env.example`
3. Test loading EEGPT model
4. Run quality checks
5. Start with simple inference script

The project is well-documented and structured. The main gap is between the comprehensive documentation and minimal code implementation. Start with the MVP approach from ROUGH_DRAFT.md rather than trying to implement the full TRD immediately.
