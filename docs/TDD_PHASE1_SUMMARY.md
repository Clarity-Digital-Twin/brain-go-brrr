# TDD Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed: Core Data Structures & Validation

### What We Built (Pure TDD)

1. **Channel Mapping & Validation** (`src/brain_go_brrr/core/channels.py`)
   - ChannelMapper: Converts old naming (T3→T7, T4→T8, T5→P7, T6→P8)
   - ChannelValidator: Ensures 19 required channels present
   - ChannelSelector: Selects standard channels in canonical order
   - ChannelProcessor: Complete pipeline combining all three

2. **EDF File Validation** (`src/brain_go_brrr/core/edf_validator.py`)
   - Duration validation (≥60s)
   - Sampling rate validation (100, 128, 200, 250, 256, 500, 512, 1000 Hz)
   - Channel count validation (≥19)
   - Data quality checks:
     - NaN/Inf detection (errors)
     - Extreme amplitude detection (>1mV warning)
     - Flat channel detection (warning)
   - Fixed: NaN-aware amplitude checking with `np.nanmax`

3. **Window Extraction** (`src/brain_go_brrr/core/window_extractor.py`)
   - WindowExtractor: 8s windows with 50% overlap
   - WindowValidator: Shape, NaN, Inf validation
   - BatchWindowExtractor: Multi-recording processing
   - Timestamp tracking for windows

4. **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/test_data_pipeline_integration.py`)
   - Full pipeline validation
   - Channel mapping → EDF validation → Window extraction
   - Edge cases: insufficient channels, short recordings, data quality issues
   - Batch processing across multiple recordings

### TDD Process Followed

```
1. Write failing test (RED)
2. Write minimal code to pass (GREEN)
3. Refactor for clarity (REFACTOR)
4. Never write code without a test first
```

### Test Coverage

- **Unit Tests**: 100% coverage for all Phase 1 components
- **Integration Tests**: 5 comprehensive scenarios testing component interaction
- **Total Tests**: 26 unit tests + 5 integration tests = 31 tests

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Each component has single responsibility
   - Easy to test in isolation
   - Clear interfaces between components

2. **Error Handling**
   - ValidationResult with errors, warnings, metadata
   - Graceful degradation (warnings vs errors)
   - Detailed error messages with context

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Efficient numpy operations
   - Minimal data copying
   - Batch processing support

### Lessons Learned

1. **NaN Handling**: Always use nan-aware numpy functions when data might contain NaN
2. **Test Data**: Create realistic test scenarios (e.g., amplitude with variation, not constant)
3. **Integration First**: Writing integration tests early helps catch interface issues

## Next: Phase 2 - Data Processing Pipeline

### Components to Build (TDD)

1. **Preprocessing Pipeline**
   - Bandpass filter (0.5-50 Hz)
   - Notch filter (50/60 Hz)
   - Z-score normalization
   - Resampling if needed

2. **AutoReject Integration**
   - Bad channel detection
   - Artifact rejection
   - Interpolation
   - Quality metrics

3. **EEGPT Feature Extraction**
   - Model loading
   - Batch processing
   - Feature caching
   - GPU optimization

### Success Metrics

- All tests pass
- <100ms processing per window
- AutoReject improves AUROC by 5%
- Memory usage <4GB for batch processing
