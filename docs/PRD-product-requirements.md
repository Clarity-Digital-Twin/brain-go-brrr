# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## EEGPT Clinical Decision Support System

### Document Control
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Status**: Draft
- **Last Updated**: 2025-01-17
- **Owner**: Product Management
- **Approvers**: Clinical Lead, Engineering Lead, Regulatory Lead

### Executive Summary
This PRD defines the requirements for an AI-powered EEG analysis system that provides clinical decision support for neurologists and EEG technicians. The system leverages the EEGPT foundation model to automate quality control, abnormality detection, and event classification.

### Problem Statement
Current EEG workflow challenges:
- 48+ hour backlogs in EEG reading
- Manual markup takes 1+ hours per study
- 20% of subtle abnormalities missed
- No triage system for urgent cases
- Inconsistent quality control

### Product Vision
Create an FDA Class II medical device software that serves as an AI co-pilot for EEG analysis, reducing turnaround time by 50% while maintaining or improving diagnostic accuracy.

### Target Users
1. **Primary Users**
   - EEG Technologists (markup assistance)
   - Neurologists/Epileptologists (clinical decision support)
   - Lab Managers (workflow optimization)

2. **Secondary Users**
   - IT Administrators (system management)
   - Quality Assurance Teams (audit trails)
   - Researchers (anonymized data analysis)
