# Session Summary - 2025-07-18

## What We Accomplished Today

1. **Fixed API Test Isolation** - Added `reset_api_state` fixture to prevent test interference
2. **Implemented UTC Time Utilities** - Created `utc_now()` and replaced all `datetime.now()` calls
3. **Added APP_VERSION to Health Endpoint** - Health check now returns version info
4. **Started EDF Streaming Fixes** - Added context manager support, fixed imports
5. **Created 7 Strategic GitHub Issues** - All tagged with @claude for tomorrow's work

## Current Test Status

- **183 passing** (91.5% pass rate)
- **17 failing** (mostly EDF streaming)
- **85.91% code coverage**

## Created GitHub Issues for Tomorrow

1. `fix-edf-streaming-tests.md` - Complete EDFStreamer implementation (HIGH)
2. `fix-mypy-type-errors.md` - Add type annotations (MEDIUM)
3. `add-redis-to-ci.md` - Wire up Redis in GitHub Actions (MEDIUM)
4. `performance-optimization-audit.md` - Validate performance requirements (HIGH)
5. `update-documentation.md` - Document recent changes (MEDIUM)
6. `complete-integration-tests.md` - Full pipeline testing (HIGH)
7. `audit-and-roadmap.md` - Strategic planning (HIGH)

## Tomorrow's Priorities

1. Fix the remaining 17 EDF streaming tests
2. Run performance benchmarks to validate 2-minute processing target
3. Complete integration tests for the full pipeline

## Key Decisions Made

- Use 120-second threshold for streaming activation
- Implement Redis auto-reconnect with exponential backoff
- Use HMAC signatures for cache endpoint authentication
- Standardize on UTC timestamps throughout the system

Good night! The Claude bot will pick up the GitHub issues tomorrow. ðŸŒ™
