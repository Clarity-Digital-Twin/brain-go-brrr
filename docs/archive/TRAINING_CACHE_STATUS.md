# Training Cache Status - Current Situation

## Summary

We discovered why the training is taking forever to load:

1. **Total windows needed**: 930,495 (from 2,717 TUAB train files)
2. **Cached windows available**: 188,981 (only ~20% cached!)
3. **Missing windows**: 741,514 (80% needs to be generated!)

## Why This Happened

The cached files appear to be from an earlier partial run that was interrupted. The dataset is now regenerating the missing 741,514 windows, which is why:

- CPU usage is at 88% on multiple cores
- Training is stuck at "Loading train_dataloader"
- It will take 2-3 hours to complete

## Current Status

- Config: Using 8s windows @ 256Hz (matches cache format)
- Process: Actively generating missing windows
- Progress: ~20% cached, 80% to go

## Options

### Option 1: Wait for Full Cache Generation (2-3 hours)
Let the current process complete. Once done, future runs will be fast.

### Option 2: Use Smaller Dataset for Quick Test
Create a config with `max_files: 100` to test with subset.

### Option 3: Clear Cache and Start Fresh
```bash
rm -rf data/cache/tuab_enhanced/*.pkl
```
Then restart - at least you'll know it's starting from 0%.

## Key Learning

The TUABEnhancedDataset caches windows incrementally. If interrupted, it resumes where it left off. This is good for fault tolerance but can be confusing when you don't realize the cache is partial.

## Recommendation

Let it run overnight to complete the cache. Tomorrow you'll have instant loading!
