# Work Summary - July 20th, 2025 Sunday at 1:44 PM

## Overview
Major technical debt reduction and cleanup of the Brain-Go-Brrr codebase based on senior developer review feedback.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Directory Structure Refactoring ✅
- Migrated entire codebase from messy duplicate structure to professional `src/brain_go_brrr/` layout
- Fixed all imports using systematic sed commands
- Preserved git history with `git mv` operations
- Synchronized changes across all branches (development, main, staging)

### 2. Type Safety Improvements ✅
- Fixed 94 mypy errors related to JobData dict vs dataclass usage
- Added GPUtil type stubs with proper naming convention overrides
- Ensured all type hints are consistent throughout codebase

### 3. Test Quality Enhancements ✅
- **Replaced hand-rolled EDF headers** with pyEDFlib fixtures for truly valid test data
- **Removed blanket-patching** of `load_edf_safe` - now using targeted mocks
- **Fixed 'skip on ERROR' anti-pattern** - tests now explicitly assert on unexpected errors
- **Added fakeredis fixture** - eliminated Redis connection warnings in unit tests
- **Split performance tests** to `tests/benchmarks/` with `@pytest.mark.perf`
- **Consolidated fixtures** in conftest.py to eliminate mock duplication

### 4. Code Quality Metrics
- Linting: ✅ All ruff checks passing
- Type checking: ✅ All mypy checks passing
- Tests: ✅ All tests passing (excluding 5 Redis serialization issues)
- Pre-commit hooks: ✅ All configured and working

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `tests/conftest.py` - Added pyEDFlib fixture, fakeredis auto-fixture
- `tests/unit/test_api.py` - Removed skip on ERROR, fixed all patches
- `tests/benchmarks/test_performance.py` - New file for perf tests
- `stubs/GPUtil.pyi` - New type stubs for GPU monitoring
- All source files - Updated imports to use `brain_go_brrr` prefix

### Dependencies Added
- `pyedflib` - For creating valid EDF test files
- `fakeredis` - For in-memory Redis during tests

## Current State
- All changes committed to development branch
- Synchronized to main and staging branches
- Ready for next phase of development

## Remaining Issues

### High Priority
1. **Fix 5 remaining test failures** - Redis cache serialization issues with JobData
2. **Update Dockerfile paths** - Still referencing old directory structure
3. **Enhance health endpoint** - Add model and Redis status checks

### Medium Priority
4. **Set up coverage gate** at 80%
5. **Add policy-lint step** for ML governance
6. **Create integration tests** for end-to-end flows

### Low Priority
7. **Document new test fixtures** in testing guide
8. **Add performance benchmarks** to CI pipeline
9. **Create developer onboarding guide**

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix remaining 5 test failures
2. **Today**: Update Dockerfile and verify container builds
3. **Tomorrow**: Begin implementing missing services (event detection, sleep analysis endpoints)
4. **This Week**: Complete first vertical slice (MVP) with full EEG pipeline

## Metrics
- Lines changed: ~700+ (434 additions, 295 deletions)
- Test quality: Significantly improved with real EDF files and proper mocking
- Technical debt: Major reduction in test brittleness and mock complexity
