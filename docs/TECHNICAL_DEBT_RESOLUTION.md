# Technical Debt Resolution Summary

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. AutoReject Status Clarification
- **Status**: FULLY IMPLEMENTED
- **Location**: `src/brain_go_brrr/data/tuab_enhanced_dataset.py`
- **Current Run**: BASELINE (AutoReject disabled with `use_autoreject: false`)
- **Next Step**: Enable AutoReject after baseline completes

### 2. Test Speed Improvements
- **Marked slow tests**: Added `@pytest.mark.slow` to model loading tests
- **Updated pytest.ini**: Excludes slow/external/gpu tests by default
- **Updated Makefile**: 
  - `make test` - Fast tests only
  - `make test-all` - All tests including slow
- **Created tiny fixtures**: `/tests/fixtures/tiny_tuab/` for fast testing

### 3. Linting Fixes
- Fixed `N812` errors: Changed `import torch.nn.functional as F` to `from torch.nn import functional as F`
- Added missing `__init__` docstrings
- Fixed variable naming (B,P,D â†’ batch_size, n_patches, feature_dim)
- Marked unused arguments with `# noqa: ARG002`

### 4. Training Progress
- **BASELINE Training**: Running successfully
- **Current AUROC**: 0.781 (already close to 80% target!)
- **GPU Usage**: ~4GB/24GB, temperature stable at 53-57Â°C
- **Status**: Training continuing, epochs progressing

## ðŸš§ Remaining Tasks

### 1. Type Checking
- `make type-check` still has issues (timed out)
- Need to run with `--ignore-missing-imports` for faster checks

### 2. Test Fixture Implementation
- Created structure but need actual mock EDF files
- Need to update integration tests to use tiny fixtures

### 3. Linting (22 remaining errors)
- Mostly docstring formatting (D205)
- Some test simplification (SIM117)
- Path operations (PTH123)

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics

- **Test Speed**: Reduced from timeout to <30s for unit tests
- **Training AUROC**: 0.781 (baseline without AutoReject)
- **Code Quality**: Major issues resolved, minor formatting remains

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Monitor Training**: Wait for baseline to complete (~45 min remaining)
2. **Run WITH AutoReject**: Change `use_autoreject: true` and rerun
3. **Compare Results**: Baseline vs AutoReject performance
4. **Clean Remaining Debt**: Fix type checking and remaining lint issues

## ðŸ”¥ SUCCESS: We're on track!
- AutoReject IS implemented
- Baseline training achieving good results
- Tests are manageable
- Ready for A/B comparison
