## [0.4.0] - 2025-07-30

### üß† Critical EEGPT Model Fixes

This release represents a major milestone in achieving functional EEGPT integration. We discovered and fixed a critical issue where the model was producing non-discriminative features (cosine similarity = 1.0) due to input scale mismatch.

### üéØ Major Improvements

- **EEGPT Normalization Fix**:
  - Root cause: Raw EEG signals (~50ŒºV) were 115x smaller than model bias terms
  - Solution: Implemented `EEGPTWrapper` with proper input normalization
  - Features now discriminative with cosine similarity ~0.486 (vs 1.0 before)
  - Normalization stats saved for reproducibility

- **Architecture Corrections**:
  - Fixed channel embedding dimensions (62 channels, 0-61 indexed)
  - Implemented custom Attention module matching EEGPT paper exactly
  - Enabled Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) for temporal encoding
  - Fixed all 8 transformer blocks loading (was missing intermediate blocks)

- **Test Infrastructure**:
  - Created minimal test checkpoint (96MB vs 1GB) for CI/CD
  - Added comprehensive checkpoint loading tests
  - Fixed test fixtures scoping issues
  - All 368 tests passing with proper type checking

### üîß Technical Details

- **Model Specifications**:
  - 10M parameters Vision Transformer
  - 4 summary tokens for feature aggregation
  - 512 embedding dimension
  - 8 transformer layers
  - Patch size: 64 samples (250ms at 256Hz)

- **Input Processing**:
  - Normalization: mean=2.9e-7, std=2.1e-5 (from dataset)
  - Patch-based processing for 4-second windows
  - Channel positional embeddings
  - RoPE for temporal relationships

### üì¶ New Components
